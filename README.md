## Thesis Abstract
This thesis examines the application of artificial intelligence to optimize optical resonator mode matching. 
A thorough experimental setup was devised, incorporating essential elements for the Pound-Drever-Hall method and developing a digital twin for AI training. 
Various improvements in AI performance were explored and assessed across different simulated environments. 
While the AI model proved successful in familiar settings by identifying optimal mode matching conditions, it encountered challenges when confronted with unfamiliar environments.
Nevertheless, notable potential lies within integrating AI into this field if adjustments are made to have the agent generate relative actions instead of absolute actions.
