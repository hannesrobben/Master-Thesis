# Master-Thesis
This is the code of my master thesis entitled "Ai-assisted real-time stabilisation of an optical resonator".
For a small insight into the work and its goal, go to the folder "Thesis Information".

## Introduction
The goal of this thesis was to investigate the possibility of the use of AI to optimize the modematching of a Fabry-Per√≥t Interferometer.
For this, i used Reinforcement Learning with the Double Deep Q-Network algorithm. The Environment is the simulation of the beam walk together with the FPI.
I used the complex q-paramter and ABCD-matrix law for the simulation of the environment and calculation of the state.


## Code Structure



## Code Evaluation



## Further Development?
I might come back to this problem and furhter investigate the implementation of the AI with the results of this thesis.
